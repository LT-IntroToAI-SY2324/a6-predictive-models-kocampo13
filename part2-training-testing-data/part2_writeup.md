# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective because it uses the traning and test datasets. The traning dataset helps the train the machine learning algorithm and the testing dataset checks the accuracy of the trained algorithm.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells you how much the x variable affects the y variable. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

This model is more accurate than the previous model but the the best to completely rely on. The values aren't too far off but there can be other variables to take into consideration.
